CHANGES:
1) Fixed bugs in lib/python/tofasta.py and lib/python/gcglib.py .
2) Enhanced lib/python/tofasta.py and lib/python/gcglib.py to support
   NIA Mouse Gene Index (niamgi) and DoTS sequences (dotsm).
3) Enhanced lib/python/tofasta.py and lib/python/gcglib.py to provide
   user-friendly error messages.

RELEASE: Alpha
CHANGES:
1) Added lib/python/CGInocontenttype.py which is identical to CGI.py
   from /usr/local/mgi/lib/python, but does not print out any HTML
   Content-Type.  CGI.py always prints out 'Content-Type: text/html'
   and seqfetch needs to have the Content-Type set to text/plain.
2) Changed lib/python/tofasta.py to use CGInocontenttype.py.
3) Changed www/tofasta.cgi to print out 'Content-Type: tex/plain\n'.

RELEASE: Alpha
CHANGES:
1) Added lib/python/Profiler.py to track elapsed time between steps in
   application.
2) Added functionality to print out elapsed time between steps in program
   when debug parameter set when calling tofasta.cgi.  The functionality
   was added to lib/python/tofasta.py and lib/python/gcglib.py .
3) Made entire tool run about 10 seconds faster by changing how files are
   transferred from the remote GCG server in lib/python/gcglib.py.  The
   old getToFASTAOutput and getGCGOutput functions would using UNIX cat
   to get the contents of the files and then remove any files from the
   remote GCG server (getToFASTAOutput removed two files, getGCGOutput
   removed one file).  Each of these UNIX commands (either two or three of
   them) were executed as separate rsh commands that required separate
   logins to the remote GCG server.  Given that the GCG environment must
   initialize at each login, this design was very inefficient.  The new
   getGCGOutput function replaces the old getToFASTAOutput and getGCGOutput
   functions and uses FTP to retrieve the contents of the files.  The
   only functionality the new getGCGOutput function does not do is to 
   remove the files from the remote GCG server.  We decided to do this
   by some cron process independent of this application.
4) Added the function printString to lib/python/gcglib.py to be used as
   a callback function when using ftplib in the getGCGOutput function.
   This also required the introduction of the global variable, contents.
